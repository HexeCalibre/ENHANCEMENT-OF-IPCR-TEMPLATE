    - **SOY-CFY:** Use this workbook if you have both Strategic Objectives and Core Functions.
    - **SON-CFY:** Use this workbook if you have Strategic Objectives but no Core Functions.
    - **SOY-CFN:** Use this workbook if you have Core Functions but no Strategic Objectives.

### 2. **Filling Out Employee Information**

- **Step 4:** Specify your office or department in cell `M8`.
- **Step 5:** Fill in the performance period start and end dates in cells `M9` and `M10`, respectively.

### 3. **Generating the Commitment Statement**

- **Step 2:** Copy the generated statement from cell `M4` and paste it into cell `A4`.
- **Step 3:** Apply any necessary formatting (bold, underline) to the text within cell `A4`.

### 4. **Inputting Strategic and Core Functions**

    - **M15:** Indicate if the Strategic Objective applies (`Y` or `N`).
    - **M16:** Indicate if the Core Functions apply (`Y` or `N`).
- **Step 2:** Based on your input, the workbook will automatically calculate the percentage allocation for Strategic, Core, and Support Functions in cells `M18:M20`.

### 5. **Logging Accomplishments**

    - **Step 2b:** Select **Insert** from the context menu to add a new row.
    - **Step 2c:** Fill in the new row with the additional accomplishment details.
- **Step 3:** The workbook will automatically count your accomplishments and display the totals in cells `C67`, `C68`, and `C69`. If you insert new rows, you may need to double-check the formulas used for counting accomplishments to ensure they include the new rows. Adjust the formulas as needed to capture all entries accurately.

### 6. **Understanding Automated Calculations**

    - **Rating Computation:** Ratings for core and support functions are calculated and displayed in cells like `D67` and `F67`.

### 7. **Finalizing the Review**

- **Step 3:** The adjectival rating (e.g., "Outstanding", "Very Satisfactory") is automatically generated in cell `D70`.

### 8. **Saving and Submitting**
- **Step 1:** Once all information has been filled out and reviewed, save the workbook with your name and the performance period as the file name.
- **Step 2:** Submit the completed workbook to your supervisor or the relevant department.
